# Face_Recognition
University students often skip class. Attendance has been a severe issue. Due to the pandemic, a simple QR code is only needed to take attendance cause students only scan the QR code without physically attending the class. Hence, we developed a face recognition-based attendance system to take attendance to solve the problem.
